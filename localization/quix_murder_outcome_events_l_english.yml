This inn is made entirely from timber and has an old thatched roof. If we cannot easily get past [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards, [target.GetSheHe] can just go up in the blaze as well. The best part about the plan is it leaves no evidence.\n\nIt could even have been an accident..."

 quix_murder_outcome.1007.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
 quix_murder_outcome.1007.d:0 "A bold plan to eliminate [target.GetName] is being discussed by my agents. It would appear there is a way into [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] quarters from the privy, of all places. A few picked soldiers would swarm in, with veils on their faces, striking down any opposition, before dispatching [target.GetTitledFirstName]. They will then escape into the night the way they came before they know what hit them."

The trip will take the better part of the day, and so [target.GetTitledFirstName] will be arriving at [target.GetHerHis] destination after nightfall.

 quix_murder_outcome.1011.d:0 "Our agents have been in contact with a warrior from a distant land. His tools and methods are strange, but he is purpotedly as fierce with his strange curved blade as he is stealthy. Perhaps we could employ them to help [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] along [target.GetHerHis] way..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.a:0 "All the better to hire someone with no connections or interests here..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1011.b:0 "This task is far too important to trust to some strange man."

 quix_murder_outcome.1012.d:0 "[target.GetName] seems to enjoy walks alone in the wilderness, where wild beasts are abound.

 quix_murder_outcome.1012.a:0 "Pick the biggest ones, and... Make sure they're hungry."
 quix_murder_outcome.1012.b:0 "No. I can't trust a beast to do a human's job."

 quix_murder_outcome.1013.t:0 "A Pool of Blood"
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.d:0 "We've learned [target.GetName] visits local healing pools every week, for a seculded bath. Naked, defenseless, and alone sounds like the perfect recipe for a successful assassination..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.a:0 "I do enjoy the irony of dying in a healing pool..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1013.b:0 "I have a bad feeling about this."

 quix_murder_outcome.1014.t:0 "A Chance Encounter"
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.d:0 "On a leisurely trip away from my domain, I was taking a pleasant stroll along a river, and who do I see, but none other than [target.GetName] standing by a bluff over the rushing water. What incredible luck that we should both happen to be here. The flow of the river is very strong today, it's doubtful anybody would ever be able to make it out..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.a:0 "Perhaps we should go help [target.GetTitledFirstName] on [target.GetHerHis] way..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1014.b:0 "As tempting as it is, I should not get my hands dirty. Or wet, for that matter."

 quix_murder_outcome.1015.t:0 "In Broad Daylight"
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.d:0 "Enough waiting.\n\nI want [target.GetTitledFirstName] dead. \n\nIf we cannot find some clever way to dispatch [target.GetHerHim], then perhaps we should do it the old fashioned way. We'll send men with full helmets, who will simply cut [target.GetHerHim] down at the first opportunity. It doesn't get any simpler than that."
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.a:0 "Send them now."
 quix_murder_outcome.1015.b:0 "No, no. We must devise a better plan."

 quix_murder_outcome.1016.t:0 "Catch and Decease"
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.d:0 "A plan has been formed by our agents to finally kill [target.GetTitledFirstName]. The plan is to catch [target.GetName] in the street and then taken [target.GetHerHim] into custody, attempting to make it seem official to onlookers. After apprehending [target.GetTitledFirstName], we bring [target.GetHerHim] here, and we can lop off [target.GetHerHis] head as we please."
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.a:0 "It sounds like a solid plan."
 quix_murder_outcome.1016.b:0 "It sounds like a terrible plan."

 quix_murder_outcome.1017.t:0 "The Exotic Weapon..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.d:0 "Our agents have acquired a novel weapon. It is a thin reed that allows a small poisoned dart to be launched at quite remarkable distances towards a target, and can deliver a fatal dose of poison. Perhaps this could be the method by which we dispatch [target.GetName] ?"
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.a:0 "What a marvelous tool."
 quix_murder_outcome.1017.b:0 "I won't trust something this important to a mere hollow stick!"

 quix_murder_outcome.1018.t:0 "Do It Yourself"
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.d:0 "I have grown sick of hearing my agents bicker over bad plans to kill [target.GetName] . If I want this done right, I'm going to have to do it myself. We know where [target.GetTitledFirstName] sleeps. I'll let myself in through a window, slip into the bedroom, and be done with it."
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.a:0 "Now where is my cowl..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1018.b:0 "On second thought, the weather just isn't right for this. Back to the infernal drawing board."

 quix_murder_outcome.1019.t:0 "The Prize Fighter"
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.d:0 "A foreign peasant, famous in his land as a pit fighter, has arrived in my realm seeking employ. His tongue was cut out long ago, and even then, he can't speak the language to begin with. He is built like a bear, and may just be the perfect one to deal with [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.a:0 "He sounds lovely!"
 quix_murder_outcome.1019.b:0 "This is not the calibur of professional I have come to expect."

 quix_murder_outcome.1020.t:0 "A Shadowy Organization..."
 quix_murder_outcome.1020.d:0 "Our agents have made contact with some people who say they can help with our [target.GetTitledFirstName] problem.
